# TODO
Several parts to the projects, for now I need to understand how I should make this game, that is what should be the architecture of the whole projects.
- server side
- client side
- middleware ? (what are those)
- data science stuff, ad-hoc then deployment ?
For now, this is far to complicated, I will first look into building the simulation, user / AI inputs and the AI "brain" behind it, if I use smart interfaces (design by contract), I should be ok.

I must not forget the goal here :
- apply / learn data science, deploying models, having feedback, automatic-learning, supervision
- understand other key concepts of dev, most that I don't even know exist
- maybe learn another language in the process

Thinking first is required.
